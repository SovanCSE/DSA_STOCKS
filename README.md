# DSA_STOCKS - WORK IN PROGRESS
Data structure and algorithm problem solving coding interview questions with python which frequently asked in FAANG companies

## DATA STRUCTURE PROBLEM SOLVING
 1. Reserve linked list with iterative way
 2. Reserve linked list with recursive way
 3. Rotate image/matrix by 90 degree
 4. singly listedlist different type of add operations (add first/last/middle after specific node/position) 

## ALGORITHM/DYNAMIC PROGRAM PROBLEM SOLVING
  1. Find first non repeating character in string
  2. Find largest subarray of sum for a specific value(k)
  3. Find first duplicate in array of elements
  4. Find first and last position of an element in array
  5. Find two sorted list in ascending order
  6. Return indices of two sum up to the specific target value
  7. Find the maximum rectangular area(width * height) to contain the most of the water without overflow
